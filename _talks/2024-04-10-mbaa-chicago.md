Today, I had the incredible experience of presenting at the OMEA/MBAA 2024 conference in Chicago. This was my first time speaking at an international conference, and I was really nervous. Despite the nerves, I learned a lot and gained valuable insights from this opportunity. 

Presenting in front of an international audience was challenging but rewarding. I realize there’s still much room for improvement, and I need to keep pushing myself to grow and gain confidence in these settings. 

Looking forward to many more opportunities like this, and here’s to continuous self-improvement!
