Welcome to my personal homepage! I am a Ph.D. student in the [Edward P. Fitts Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.ise.ncsu.edu/) at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/). I am truly honored to be recognized as an [Edward P. Fitts Graduate Fellow](https://ise.ncsu.edu/alumni/fitts-scholars-and-fellows/#fellows).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Data-Driven Modeling**, **Operations Research**, and **Optimization**. I am particularly focused on developing individualized forecasting frameworks to enhance proactive fulfillment in logistics and supply chain systems.

Biography
======
I was born in [Wuwei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuwei,_Gansu), a small city in Gansu Province, Northwestern China, known for its historical significance as an important city on the ancient [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road). I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Logistics Engineering from [Fuzhou University](https://www.fzu.edu.cn/). Before joining NC State, I completed my Master’s degree in Industrial & Systems Engineering [https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/industrial-systems-engineering] at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), located in [Madison](https://www.visitmadison.com/)—a charming and picturesque town in the heart of the American Midwest. 

Growing up as the only child in my family, I learned to be independent and make my own decisions from an early age. I enjoy trying new things and constantly seek opportunities to challenge myself and grow, whether in academic research or personal life. Beyond my studies, I am a [Lean Six Sigma Green Belt](https://www.aigpe.org/). I love outdoor hiking because being close to nature brings me a sense of inner peace, and I also enjoy the satisfaction of tasting my own culinary creations in the kitchen. Here, I plan to share my random thoughts, research experiences, and reading notes.
