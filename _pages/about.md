About me
======
My name is Bo Shao, but most people just call me Bo. I was born in [Wuwei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuwei,_Gansu), a small city in Gansu Province, Northwestern China, known for its historical significance as an important city on the [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road). I earned my bachelor’s degree in Logistics Engineering from [Fuzhou University](https://www.fzu.edu.cn/), where I met teachers and friends who had a significant impact on my life. Currently, I am pursuing my Master’s degree in [Industrial & Systems Engineering](https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/industrial-systems-engineering) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu), located in [Madison](https://www.visitmadison.com/), a charming and picturesque town in the heart of the American Midwest. I enjoy trying new things and constantly seek opportunities to challenge myself and grow. Growing up as the only child in my family, I learned to be independent and make my own decisions. I love outdoor hiking because being close to nature brings me a sense of inner peace. I also enjoy cooking, and there’s nothing quite like the satisfaction of tasting my own culinary creations. Here, I plan to share my random thoughts, experiences, and reading notes.
