## About me

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.8;">
My name is Bo Shao, but most people just call me Bo. I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuwei,_Gansu">Wuwei</a>, a small city in Gansu Province, Northwestern China, known for its historical significance as an important city on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road">Silk Road</a>. I earned my bachelor’s degree in Logistics Engineering from <a href="https://www.fzu.edu.cn/">Fuzhou University</a>, where I met teachers and friends who had a significant impact on my life. Currently, I am pursuing my Master’s degree in <a href="https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/industrial-systems-engineering">Industrial & Systems Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>, located in <a href="https://www.visitmadison.com/">Madison</a>, a charming and picturesque town in the heart of the American Midwest. I enjoy trying new things and constantly seek opportunities to challenge myself and grow. Growing up as the only child in my family, I learned to be independent and make my own decisions. I love outdoor hiking because being close to nature brings me a sense of inner peace. I also enjoy cooking, and there’s nothing quite like the satisfaction of tasting my own culinary creations. Here, I plan to share my random thoughts, experiences, and reading notes.
